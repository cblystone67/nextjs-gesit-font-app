# Detailed Development Plan for Corrections to Connections Website

This plan outlines file-by-file changes, new file creation, and integration strategies to build a fully functional website using Next.js with free/mock integrations (PayPal for donations, OpenStreetMap for housing/meetings, and simulated email service). The design will use a modern, bridge-themed concept with clean typography, blue gradients, ample spacing, and a layout that conveys building bridges across boundaries.

---

## 1. Project Structure & New Files

### A. Pages (Under /src/app)
- **Home Page:** Create or update `/src/app/page.tsx`
  - Add a hero section displaying a mission statement.
  - Include an image:  
    `<img src="https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Inspirational+modern+bridge+concept+with+uplifting+message" alt="Inspirational modern bridge concept conveying a hopeful message of building connections and overcoming boundaries" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='fallback.jpg';" />`
  - Show founders’ introductions and impact statistics.
  - Provide navigation links to key sections (Housing, Meetings, Education).

- **About Page:** Create `/src/app/about/page.tsx`
  - Include the organization origin story, mission, values, statistics on recidivism, and contact information.

- **Founder Pages:** Create three pages:
  - `/src/app/founders/chad/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/founders/dustin/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/founders/christopher/page.tsx`  
  Each page will include:
  - A personal narrative with transformation details.
  - Embedded HTML5 video components for testimonials (with `<video>` tags and fallback text).
  - Current role descriptions.

- **Housing Resources Page:** Create `/src/app/housing/page.tsx`
  - Embed an interactive map. Develop a new component at `/src/components/ui/MapComponent.tsx` using React-Leaflet (free alternative to Google Maps).
  - Add a search filter component (new file `/src/components/ui/search-filter.tsx`).
  - Fetch data from a local JSON file (e.g., `/data/housing.json`) via utility functions.

- **Recovery Meetings Page:** Create `/src/app/meetings/page.tsx`
  - Include tabbed sections for A.A. and N.A. meetings.
  - Implement search filtering by location/time.
  - Incorporate a calendar view (use a simple grid layout if not integrating a calendar library).

- **Educational Support Page:** Create `/src/app/education/page.tsx`
  - List college programs, vocational training, navigators, and success stories.
  - Use card components from existing UI library (e.g., `/src/components/ui/card.tsx`).

- **Donations Page:** Create `/src/app/donations/page.tsx`
  - Develop a donation portal with clear sections for donation levels, recurring giving, and corporate partnerships.
  - Integrate a PayPal donation button using the free PayPal SDK approach.
  - Use modern layout, ensuring no external icon libraries; only typography, colors, and spacing.

- **Donation History (Admin Only):** Create `/src/app/admin/donations/page.tsx`
  - Secure this route with a simple admin authentication check.
  - Display a donor management table and transaction history.
  - Integrate report generation elements.

### B. API Endpoints (Under /src/pages/api)
- **Donations Endpoint:** Create `/src/pages/api/donations.ts`
  - Implement `POST` (to record donation details) and `GET` (to fetch donation history) methods.
  - Validate request payloads and return appropriate error status (e.g., 400 for missing fields).
  - Write donation data into a local JSON file (e.g., `/data/donations.json`) using helper functions.

- **Additional Endpoints:**
  - **Contact/Email Submissions:** Create `/src/pages/api/contact.ts` for handling contact forms.
  - **Housing & Meetings Data:** Optionally create endpoints to serve data, or have frontend load from local JSON files.

## 2. Utility & Library Changes

### A. Database Utility
- **File:** `/src/lib/db.ts`
  - Add functions such as `readData(filePath: string)` and `writeData(filePath: string, data: any)` using Node's fs/promises.
  - Include try/catch for error handling and log errors properly.

### B. PayPal Integration Helper
- **File:** `/src/lib/paypal.ts`
  - Create helper functions to simulate PayPal SDK calls.
  - Ensure error catching and integration with the donations API.

### C. Global Styles
- **File:** `/src/app/globals.css`
  - Incorporate a modern, bridge-themed color palette (e.g., blue gradients, white backgrounds).
  - Update typography and spacing rules for consistency across devices.
  - Define custom utility classes if needed.

### D. Error Boundary Component
- **File:** `/src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
  - Implement a React error boundary component to wrap major page sections or components.
  - Display user-friendly error messages and log the errors.

---

## 3. UI/UX Component Updates

### A. Header & Footer
- **New Files:**  
  - `/src/components/ui/header.tsx` – Contains site navigation using simple text links styled with Tailwind CSS.
  - `/src/components/ui/footer.tsx` – Contains useful links, social sharing text (no icons), and copyright info.

### B. Map Component
- **File:** `/src/components/ui/MapComponent.tsx`
  - Integrate React-Leaflet for rendering the interactive map.
  - Add error handling if the map fails to load, providing a fallback message.

### C. Search Filter Component
- **File:** `/src/components/ui/search-filter.tsx`
  - Create a generic search filter component that accepts props like placeholder text and callback functions.
  - Style the component to match the modern, clean UI theme.

### D. Video Components on Founder Pages
- Use HTML `<video>` with controls and fallback text in each founder page.
- Ensure accessibility with proper `aria-label` attributes.

---

## 4. Third-Party and Package Adjustments

- **Package.json:**
  - Add necessary dependencies (e.g., `react-leaflet`, `paypal-checkout` if available, and file system packages if needed).
  - Verify all shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS configurations are current.
  
- **Next.config.ts:**
  - Confirm static asset handling and API routes are correctly configured.
  
- **Testing:**
  - Validate API endpoints with curl commands. Example for donations API:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/donations \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"donorName": "John Doe", "amount": 50, "paymentMethod": "Paypal", "notes": "Test donation"}'
    ```
  - Use browser testing for responsive UI checks and error boundaries.

---

## 5. Error Handling & Best Practices

- Use try/catch blocks in API and database utility functions.
- Show fallback UI in components (e.g., map and video components) if external resources fail to load.
- Ensure all forms have validation with user-friendly messages.
- Follow accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, aria attributes).
- Utilize proper logging and monitoring in development mode.

## Summary
- Updated Next.js pages for Home, About, Founder stories, Housing, Meetings, Education, Donations, and Admin views.
- Created new UI components (Header, Footer, MapComponent, SearchFilter, and ErrorBoundary) with modern typography and layout.
- Integrated free alternatives: PayPal for donations, React-Leaflet for maps, and simulated email handling.
- Developed API endpoints in `/src/pages/api` and utilities in `/src/lib` with robust error handling.
- Global styling enhanced in `/src/app/globals.css` to reflect a bridge-themed design.
- Thorough testing via curl commands and browser responsive testing ensures functional integrity.
